So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by
  and the kings who ruled them
  had courage and greatness.
We have heard of these princes' noble campaigns.
There was Shielf-Sheafson, wrecker of mead-halls...

Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness,
and some have greatness thrust upon them.
